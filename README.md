Spoutshafter
============

a project created by Download13 (Mineshafter) then later forked by tr0lit (Mineshafter/Spoutshafter Squared)


Spoutshafter using Mineshafter auth.

Hopefully later commits will fix Skin and Capes/Cloaks issue.
This should also prevent Mineshafter from going over quota as much *fingers crossed*!
